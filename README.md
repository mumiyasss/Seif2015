 * Grebnev Kolya, @mumiyasss, 15 years old;
 * It's a free software.
 * These program was written just for fun
 * and to write all my new knowledge in C++
 * programming language in one project:)
 *
 * How to:
 *
 *  You have to work with commands, so
 *  here are they:
 *
 *      seifenc - will encrypt your message;
 *      seifdec - will decrypt your encrypted message;
 *      calc    - will calculate the problem you will write;
 *      days    - will calculate how many days was between 2 dates;
 *      memory  - it's a game, were you need to remember numbers;
 *      exit    - finish to work with program.
 *
 *  In retry operation, you should enter 'y' or 'n',
 *  where 'y' - restart last operation and 'n' - go
 *  to command system.
 *
 * Good luck, lol :D
